# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Front-end test

In this test, you’re given a design of a basic web-page on a phone. Your task is to code a similar looking webpage for mobile, that also scales well for tablet and desktop.

For screen sizes, we’re going with very standardized screen widths:

1. 414(W) X 896(H) (iPhone 11)
2. 768(W) X 1024(H) (Most iPads)
3. 1280(W) X 720(H) (Common minimum laptop resolution)

There doesn’t need to be any real functionality, e.g. the “Contact us” button can simply console log “message sent!” and the hamburger menu should only open up and show dummy links, not redirect to other pages.

However, the test will have more emphasis on responsive design and reusable components. For “fetching” data, don’t worry about any external calls, keep all the data local.

Here are a couple of things to think about:

1. What happens with the image on different screen sizes? How does it scale?
2. How will the list of employees respond to a long name, or if the list is longer or shorter?
3. Does a hamburger menu make sense on a bigger screen?
4. What happens with the footer on wider devices?
